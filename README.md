# LibreInventory
Libre Inventory is a simple android inventory application

It supports thousands of products with optimized autocompletion editor to find product.
A search by barcode or reference is also possible.
Then you can specify quantity and localisation during inventory.

Firstly you need to add a csv file products.csv in Download directory on your android device, then click on import button to load products.
You can then make inventory and export it in Download directory or send it by email.

To build project you can use Android Studio 2.3.2.
